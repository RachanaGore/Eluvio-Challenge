# Eluvio-Challenge
  I have chosen to solve Option 1 - Data Science/ML(Analytical Modeling) from Coding Challenge options.
# Problem - Sentiment Analysis using Vader
- Since the data was unlabelled, I have used 'Vader' to perform Sentiment Analysis.

- I have used this particular module as it works well with unlabelled data.
